Recon phase:

–> NMAP (ports open 21, 53, 80, 135, 139, 389, 443, 445, 464, 593, 636, 3268, 3269 open)
–> GoBuster (finds “certserv”)
–> SMB share check (smbclient) 
–> smbclient –list //sizzle.htb/ -U “”

SMB contains share for Active Directory Certificate Service (hosted at http://sizzle.htb/certserv)
→ “Department Shares” SMB is writable in 2 directories, ZZ_ARCHIVE and Users/Public
→ Since writable by unauthenticated users, vulnerable to SCF attacks.

→ use responder to capture hash, crack with johntheripper
→ get password
→ try accessing “certenroll” SMB so we can generate a certificate. This cert will be used for WinRM (Windows Remote management)

→ “smbclient //sizzle.htb/certenroll -U amanda”
→ contains certificate information for the share
→ accessing sizzle.htb/certserv allows

Another NMAP scan shows that wsman and wsmans port are open. Which is for WinRM. Each running HTTPAPI.

To connect to HTTP, we need to create a key and certificate. 

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout request.key -out request.csr

Go back to /certserv, submit advanced cert request, access base64 encoded cert

WinRM shell: https://github.com/Alamot/code-snippets/blob/master/winrm/winrm_shell.rb

No winRM on Linux, so must use Ruby library for it. Which is in the link above.
